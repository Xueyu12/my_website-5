China is famous for its ancient culture. "Jiangnan" is a concentrated symbol of Chinese culture. 

What is "Jiangnan"? 
Like other ancient culture, the river is of vital importance. We Chinese have 2 important rivers, the Yellow River(Huang He) and the Yangtze River(Chang Jiang). The directions to the river are used to divide regions and this also relate to our culture. "Jiangnan" means south to Yangtze River. 

Cities in "Jiangnan" are mainly water towns and grow up gentle and soft people comparing to rough and straight people in the north. Suzhou is the most famous "Jiangnan" city around 30 mins train from Shanghai. 

I travelled there with my friend Zoe Zhou. We visited the Museum of Suzhou, the most beautiful combination of modern and ancient construction style in the whole world. You can see part of the building from the head picture. 

It was spring and everything was amazing. 
Jiangnan in our culture is the symbol for story. Hope you can find some stories from my pics.
