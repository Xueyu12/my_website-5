Hi! This is Shirley Wan. I'm now a class of MFA2022 at LBS. 

I was born in Dec 18 1998 in the North East part of China. The province Liaoning is known as the "First-born son" of our country, which means she was the pillar of our economy. 

In 2016, I entered Fudan University in Shanghai. I graduated from the university majoring in Financial Management after 5 year. Normally, except for construction and medical major, people don't attend undergraduate study for that long. It's because I changed my major. I used to study natural science, where I found no enthusiasm. 

I'm known as a **funny** person among my friends. I'm passionate and helpful. I have many friends and I enjoy expanding my social network. You could always find me chatting with more than 10 people at the same time on WeChat (A China version Whatsapp+Facebook+Ins). If you see me awkward and alone, it must be my poor English fails me. 

So much about my self introduction. If you want to know me, how about visit other pages?
