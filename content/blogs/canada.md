I had an exchange semester in Canada. Ivey Business School locates in London, Canada. It is one of the best business school in Canada and is famous for its Case Study Teaching Method.I was quite lucky to fully experience my life there before the Covid-19 pandemic.

#Montreal and Quebec
I went my first trip to Montreal and Quebec with 4 other girls. The journey wasn't as pleasant as we imagined. 
One of our friend caught a flu on the flight to Montreal. She had to lay in bed the first day. 
Montreal is a French speaking region and its people can not speak too much English. We struggled to find noodles for dinner at the supermarket. When we try to communicate with the sales guy there, a man stared at us and frightened us. The next day, three of us were chased by a madman at the tube! 
However, even though the beginning sucks. We love the scenery during that journey.

#Vancuour
I went to Vancuour with 2 girls. The city is very different from the French region. It's bright, warm and modern. Uber was not allowed by the local government there, so the travel was a little bit difficult. We rushed to the Hotpot restaurant for lunch and headed for the city center since I had a show that night. It shocked us that the stores closed at 5 pm in Van. I watched a world tour show of the famous Chinese comedian of Chinese traditional crosstalk. It was so funny!
